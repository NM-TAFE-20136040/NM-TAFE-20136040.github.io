### Assessment

My first assessment was pretty straight forward for me. It mostly
dealt with creating a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site
in one of my repo's. Which included version control with git and
writing a few markdown pages.

### My Confusion

Since I haven't really done any schooling since my 20's I was a bit
lost on how to go about things. There is so many new applications and
interfaces I have to learn. In the assessment there is a basic overview
section which I kinda took as a project outline and since I've done
some programming, that's kinda all I needed to complete what I thought
was the task. That's how this blog page came to be....

### The Task

Turns out the assessment was laid out step by step and what you needed
to do. Which meant all the work I did on this doesn't really matter all
that much haha. Basically I just had to set my user.name, user.email and
init.defaultBranch to certain values.

```
git config --global user.name "name"
git config --global user.email "email@email.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch "main"
```

These are generally pretty basic things you do if you use git. You wont
be able to commit any changes without them set either way, excluding
init.defaultBranch that is.

The assessment basically followed this general theme. Do a task listed and
provide screenshots as evidence. Some of the other task were to:

- push my initial work to a remote repo
- create a new branch locally
- make changes and commit them on that branch
- push chagne to the repo under the new branch
- make a pull request and merge those changes to the main branch

After all that I informed my "manger" with a mock email and concluded my
assessment.

### Conclusion

I need to slow down and can't assume that things will be these major workflow
tasks that need to be completed. Though hopefully that will come but you gotta
walk (even if it's a path you've been on before) before you can run aye.
