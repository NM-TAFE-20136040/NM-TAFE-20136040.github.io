I'm Robert MacLeod and I've been programming on and off for most of my life.

#### Education

Self taught programmer for the most part. This year I've started to do courses on Udemy,
and began a TAFE Certificate IV for Programming. Hoping to complete Certificate V Diploma
next semester.

#### Projects

Most of my projects have been small scale. The project I've worked on the most is my
[Discord-Bot](https://github.com/sarca571ca/discord-tracker-bot). Simple bot that was
designed for a specific use. Outside of that I've contributed to a few FFXI Private
server projects.

#### Hobbies

Enjoy playing american football, gaming, and programming. Anything that requires a lot
of problem solving.
